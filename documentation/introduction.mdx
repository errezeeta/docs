### Getting started

Welcome! Read this page to learn a bit more about TrueCold Public API and how to integrate your data-input tools with our platform.&#x20;

<Tip>
  If you want to book a demo, get in contact with [support@truecold.io](mailto:support@truecold.io).
</Tip>

### 1. Security

At TrueCold we take security very seriously, so our API validates every request. We make sure that the right scope is returned every time. To do so, we use **private API keys**. To get one, log in at [truecold.io](https://truecold.io) and head to the *account* page. Under the *Api credentials* page, you will be able to generate or delete your api keys.&#x20;

<Warning>
  Due to security reasons, you **will only see your api key once**. Make sure you save it properly.&#x20;
</Warning>

You will need to have the role **ADMIN** to be able to manage API keys. If you have any questions, get in contact with our [Support Team](mailto:support@truecold.io).

In every request, you will need to provide an API key in the headers:

```
x-api-key: tc_your-api-key
```

### 2. Rate limits

To ensure that everyone can use our API, we allow up to **5 requests every 10 seconds** (sliding window). If you think you need more requests per 10 seconds, please, contact with our [Support Team](mailto:support@truecold.io) and we will study your case individually.&#x20;

If you exceed that amount of requests, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response, with the following structure:&#x20;

```
{
  isError: true,
  message: "Rate limit exceeded",
  limit: 5,
  reset: 4
}
```
