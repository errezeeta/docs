## Overview
The TrueCold Webhook allows you to receive real-time notifications about important events in your system.

In this quickstart guide, you will learn how to set up a webhook and receive notifications for new alerts.

TrueCold allows you to create different types of webhooks fot different events. By now, the app
supports the following webhooks:

- [Alerts](./alert/alert-webhook) : Triggered when an alert has been generated or updated on some entity linked with a sensor.
- [Assessment](./assessment/assessment-webhook) : Triggered when an assessment has been generated or updated on some entity.
- [Sensor](./sensor/sensor-webhook) : Triggered when a sensor has been created, updated or deleted.

## Setting Up the Webhook

To set up a Webhook, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Webhook Endpoint**: Set up an endpoint on your server to receive webhook events. This endpoint should be able to handle HTTP requests.

2. **Register the Webhook**: Register your webhook endpoint in the TrueCold app. You can do this by clicking on the *Add new Webhook* located in the *Integrations* tab from the *Account* page.
