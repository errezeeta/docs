## Setting Up the Webhook

To set up a Webhook, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Webhook Endpoint**: Set up an endpoint on your server to receive webhook events. This endpoint should be able to handle HTTP requests.

2. **Register the Webhook**: Register your webhook endpoint in the TrueCold app. You can do this by clicking on the *Add new Webhook* located in the *Integrations* tab from the *Account* page.
