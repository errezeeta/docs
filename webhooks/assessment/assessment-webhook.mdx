The Assessment Webhook allows you to receive real-time notifications about the assessment status of your entities. This document provides an overview of how to set up and use the Assess Webhook.

## Alert Event types

The Alert Webhook sends notifications for the following event types:

- `assessment.created` : Triggered when a new assess has been created.
- `assessment.updated` : Triggered when an existing assessment has been modified

## Event Payload

When an alert is triggered, the app will send request to your webhook endpoint with the following payload:
