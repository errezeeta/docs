The Sensor Webhook allows you to receive real-time notifications about the status of your sensors. This document provides an overview of how to set up and use the Sensor Webhook.

## Sensor Event types

The Alert Webhook sends notifications for the following event types:

- `sensor.created` : Triggered when a new sensor has been linked to an entity.
- `sensor.updated` : Triggered when the status of a sensor link has been changed.

## Event Payload

When an alert is triggered, the app will send request to your webhook endpoint with the following payload:

```json
{
    "event": "sensor.created",
    "data": {
        "id": "33afebfa-14da-4ce8-add9-597b63e2bdd8",
        "account_id" : "33afebfa-14da-4ce8-add9-597b63e2bdd8",
        "entity_id" : "33afebfa-14da-4ce8-add9-597b63e2bdd8"
    }
}
```
